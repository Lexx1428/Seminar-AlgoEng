Things todo for implementation of Algo 1:

-function to compute profit sequence P[...]

-somehow make sure that our instances are balanced (monotone, non-decreasing) 
 since algo 1 is only for balanced instances, no idea how so far

-create function for maxPlus convolution, should be doable (formula in paper)

-adapt algo1.cpp to all the new things and changes (structs, new variables, etc)

-create presentation for monday!!!
