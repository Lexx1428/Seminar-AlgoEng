Seminar: Algorith Engineering



Topic 4: Core problems in knapsack: The core of knapsack was introduced in the 1980s to reduce knapsack instances to the relevant parts, such that determining a solution for the core can be lifted to a solution for the entire instance: https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.47.4.570. The latest study for these types of algorithms were already proposed long ago, and they cover, for example, randomly generated instances, and are compared to the state of the art of that time. However, in recent years many new algorithms were proposed for knapsack with much stronger theoretical guarantees, such as https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05681. The task here is to engineer novel knapsack algorithms to work well on benchmark data sets.


After the seminar kick-off on Monday, 14 October, the next seminar meeting is scheduled for Monday, 11 November, again via Zoom. The proposed time is 12.30pm, which should not cause any conflict with any of your other lectures (in case I overlooked something, please let me know).

It is expected that by then, you have a small (!) working prototype to present. This means an algorithm that either solves some special case of the problem, or that solves the general problem but by a very simple approach (e.g., brute force).

On that occasion, each team of 2 students should present their progress on the problem to the other students (they are your main audience). This means that you should provide a short presentation of about 7 minutes where you introduce the problem, you give some examples, show the demo of your abovementioned prototype, and you also describe your current challenges.  The audience  Recall that I said during the kick-off meeting that you should not present any actual code, but rather present the ideas of your program (which can be done in pseudocode if you wish).

Recall that the expected overall work time of each team of two students is 180 hours over the course of the semester, which means 90 hours per student, or about 6 hours per week during term time.
