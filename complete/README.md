# Algorithm Engineering: Knapsack Problem

Implementation of an algorithm for the 1/0 - Knapsack problem in terms of the seminar Algorithm Engineering by Professor Matthias Mnich at TUHH.

# Description
More specifically implementation of algorithm 1 from the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05681. Algorithm 1 only works for balanced instances, which is why we first need to reduce the knapsack instance (consisting of items and capacity) to a balanced instance. 
All the functions are defined in allfunctions.cpp.
